## Introduction

**nf-core/scdownstream** is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to process already quantified single-cell RNA-seq data. It takes a samplesheet and h5ad-, SingleCellExperiment/Seurat- or CSV files as input and performs quality control, integration, dimensionality reduction and clustering. It produces an integrated h5ad and SingleCellExperiment file and an extensive QC report.

The pipeline is based on the learnings and implementations from the following pipelines (alphabetical):

- [panpipes](https://github.com/DendrouLab/panpipes)
- [scFlow](https://combiz.github.io/scFlow/)
- [scRAFIKI](https://github.com/Mye-InfoBank/scRAFIKI)
- [YASCP](https://github.com/wtsi-hgi/yascp)

Steps marked with the boat icon are not yet implemented. For the other steps, the pipeline uses the following tools:

1. Per-sample preprocessing
   1. Convert all RDS files to h5ad format
   2. Create filtered matrix (if not provided)
   3. Present QC for raw counts ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))
   4. Remove ambient RNA
      - [decontX](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/decontX.html)
      - [soupX](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SoupX/readme/README.html)
      - [cellbender](https://cellbender.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
      - [scAR](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/user_guide/models/scar.html)
   5. Apply user-defined QC filters (can be defined per sample in the samplesheet)
   6. Doublet detection (Majority vote possible)
      - [SOLO](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/user_guide/models/solo.html)
      - [scrublet](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/scanpy.pp.scrublet.html)
      - [DoubletDetection](https://doubletdetection.readthedocs.io/en/v2.5.2/doubletdetection.doubletdetection.html)
      - [SCDS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/scds/inst/doc/scds.html)
2. Sample aggregation
   1. Merge into a single h5ad file
   2. Present QC for merged counts ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))
   3. Integration
      - [scVI](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/user_guide/models/scvi.html)
      - [scANVI](https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/user_guide/models/scanvi.html)
      - [Harmony](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/harmony/articles/quickstart.html)
      - [BBKNN](https://github.com/Teichlab/bbknn)
      - [Combat](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/scanpy.pp.combat.html)
      - [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_introduction)
3. Cell type annotation
   - [celltypist](https://www.celltypist.org/)
4. Clustering and dimensionality reduction
   1. [Leiden clustering](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/scanpy.tl.leiden.html)
   2. [UMAP](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/scanpy.tl.umap.html)
5. Create report ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are confused by the terms `filtered` and `unfiltered`, please check out the respective [documentation](https://nf-co.re/scdownstream/dev/docs/usage/#filtered-and-unfiltered-matrices).

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

```csv title="samplesheet.csv"
sample,unfiltered
sample1,/absolute/path/to/sample1.h5ad
sample2,/absolute/path/to/sample3.h5
sample3,relative/path/to/sample2.rds
sample4,/absolute/path/to/sample3.csv
```

Each entry represents a h5ad, h5, RDS or CSV file. RDS files may contain any object that can be converted to a SingleCellExperiment using the [Seurat `as.SingleCellExperiment`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/as.singlecellexperiment) function.
CSV files should contain a matrix with genes as columns and cells as rows. The first column should contain cell names/barcodes.

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/scdownstream \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/scdownstream/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/scdownstream/parameters).
